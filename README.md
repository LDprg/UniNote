# UniNote
UniNote is a note taking program for Students!
It focuses on high drawing performance and student related features.
To achieve this it uses SDL3 and VULKAN combined with ImGui.

This project is early into development so do not expect much out of it, but feel free to contribute.

# WARNING
DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE IN PRODUCTION AND NOT EVEN ALPHA QUALITY
AND THERE IS NOTHING LIKE COMPATIBILITY EVEN BETWEEN MINOR VERSIONS

This repository contains a lot of bad and dirty code, which will get some cleanups. Don't expect anything working for now!
